                    <p>For the last 15 years, Ariel has been very fortunate to attend numerous schools and programs for voice. Ariel is currently enrolled in her 4th year of her B.Mus degree in Voice at Queen’s University, where she has had the opportunity to enroll in many seminars pertaining to music education.</p>
                    <p>This summer, Ariel  will be performing the role of Barbarina in Mozart’s "Marriage of Figaro" with Summer Opera Lyric Theatre. Other than her pre-scheduled rehearsals, she is completely flexible to teach lessons at any time/day.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to singing, Ariel strongly believes that a healthy singer should be able to switch vocal genres with ease and comfort. As a voice teacher, Ariel strives to expose singers to a wide variety of music that suits their voice, all while creating a curriculum that focuses on what they hope to gain from their lessons. In addition, Ariel balances her lessons with a blend of research she's compiled on the voice, with practical experience that she's gained through the years of her own performance study.</p>
